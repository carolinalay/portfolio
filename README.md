|[When was the Golden Age of Video Games?](https://github.com/carolinalay/guided_projects/tree/main/When%20was%20the%20Golden%20Age%20of%20Video%20Games%3F)|In this project, I analyzed two datasets to find out the Golden Age of Video Games using SQL to solve 8 assigned tasks in the DataCamp platform. In addition, I performed data verification in M. Excel to compare the results, and created a visualization in Tableau to share the answers to the questions.| Data Manipulation: Inner & Left Joins, Filter data (Limit, Except, Intersect), Group By and Order By - Data Verification: Pivot Table, Conditional Formatting (Top 10 Items, Rules), Merge (Left & Inner Join in Power Query) - Tableau Visualization: Inner & Left Join, Stories, and simplified Dashboard|
|[Analyzing NYC public schools test result scores](https://github.com/carolinalay/portfolio/tree/main/Analyzing%20NYC%20public%20school%20test%20result%20scores)|Project required an analysis of a dataset of the average scores in math, reading and writing of NYC public schools. There were 9 assigned tasks to complete using SQL in Jupyter Notebook. To verify that queries return correct results, I performed the same tasks in M. Excel, and created a visualization in Power BI to share the answers to the questions.| Data Manipulation: Filter data (Limit, Where), Aggregate Functions (Min, Max, Count, SUM) - Data Verification: Pivot Table, Merge (Inner Join in Power Query), Functions (Index & Match, Vlookup, CountIf, CountA) - PowerBI: Filter (Top 10), DAX formulas (SUMX, DIVIDE, CountA), simplified tables|

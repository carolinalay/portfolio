|[When was the Golden Age of Video Games?](https://github.com/carolinalay/guided_projects/tree/main/When%20was%20the%20Golden%20Age%20of%20Video%20Games%3F)|In this project, I analyzed two datasets to find out the Golden Age of Video Games using SQL to solve 8 assigned tasks in the DataCamp platform. In addition, I performed by myself a data verification in M. Excel to compare the results, and created a visualization in Tableau to share the answers to the questions.| Data Manipulation: Inner & Left Joins, Filter data (Limit, Except, Intersect), Group By and Order By - Data Verification: Pivot Table, Conditional Formatting (Top 10 Items, Rules), Merge (Left & Inner Join in Power Query) - Tableau Visualization: Inner & Left Join, Stories, and simplified Dashboard|

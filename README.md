|When was the Golden Age of Video Games?|In this project, I analyzed two datasets to find out the Golden Age of Video Games using SQL to solve 8 assigned tasks in a Jupyter notebook in DataCamp platform. In addition, I performed by myself a data verification in M. Excel to compare the results and created a visualization in Tableau to share the conclusion.| Data Manipulation: Inner & Left Joins, Filter data (Limit, Except, Intersect), Group & Order By. 
Data Verification: Pivot Table, Conditional Formatting (Top 10 Items, Rules), Power Query (Left & Inner Join). 
Tableau Visualization: Inner & Left Join, Stories, and simplified Dashboard.|
